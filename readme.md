# Hello there!!

This is my **first** readme file ever to be uploaded on a GitHub repository. So I hope that you don't expect too much from this file. This file's gonna be **all about me.** 

Again, this is **Murali Krishna** from *1st year Production Engineering* and this is my submission for the **Spider WebDev inductions.**

 - [x] Gritty about Git
 - [x] A personal webpage? Why not?
 - [x] Fastest fingers first

### More about me? Here you go 

 1. I'm pretty **good with singing**. Listening to good music has always been a part of my life.
 2. I aspire to **become an entrepreneur**. 
 3. I had the **habit of reading a lot of books** but now, unfortunately, I haven't been having time for such serious reading.
 4. I'm not too much into code but I've always been attracted to it. I find it extremely interesting and **would love to be a serious front-end developer**.

Okay, so that's pretty much with which I can wrap this documentation.
